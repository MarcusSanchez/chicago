About Chicago Career Collective, LLC
A Personal Story &amp; Personalized Support:
Chicago Career Collective was born from a deeply personal path. I first stepped into career
services at the age of 20 as a work-study peer advisor at the University of Minnesota. That
experience sparked a lifelong passion for helping others find their professional voice. Over the
years, I’ve worked with diverse populations—from recent grads and mid-career changers to
creatives, tech professionals, and nonprofit leaders—always with the goal of helping them align
their skills with work that fits their lives.
I created this practice to offer a thoughtful, human-centered approach to career development
rooted in strategy, equity, and real transformation. In today’s rapidly evolving job market, that
means supporting clients as they adapt to AI-influenced industries and the rise of
automation—preparing them to not only survive change, but lead through it.
At Chicago Career Collective, we pride ourselves on offering personalized career support
tailored to your unique needs. Our approach focuses on understanding your goals and aspirations
to help you navigate your career path effectively. We believe that everyone has the potential to
achieve their career goals, and our services are designed to help you discover your strengths,
explore your passions, and develop a clear, actionable plan for success.
